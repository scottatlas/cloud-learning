# Cloud Support Learning Journey

This repository documents my 2-month Cloud Support / DevOps learning progress.

## AWS
- Day 5: Static website hosted on Amazon S3

## Python Automation
- Day 8: Python basics — variables, user input, and simple calculations
- Day 9–14 (coming soon): boto3 automation scripts for AWS

**Next steps:**  
Add CloudFront configuration (Day 6) once AWS account verification is completed.
